#! Feature Specification: Lucky Break Core Experience

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-re-building`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we're building a game called Lucky Break, which will be made on top of matterJS, toneJS, pixiJS, vite, and typescript"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start And Finish A Round (Priority: P1)

Players launch Lucky Break, begin a session, and successfully clear enough bricks to complete the opening level.

**Why this priority**: Establishes the core loop and ensures the game delivers immediate value and a sense of accomplishment.

**Independent Test**: A tester can load the experience, play a full round from first launch to level completion, and confirm score and progression updates without any auxiliary features enabled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a first-time player on a supported browser, **When** they start the game, **Then** the experience guides them into active play within 10 seconds.
2. **Given** an active game session, **When** the player clears the final brick, **Then** the game records the score, celebrates the win, and surfaces the next-step prompt or replay option without delay.

### User Story 2 - Experience Audio-Synced Gameplay (Priority: P2)

Players hear responsive sound effects and evolving music that reflects their in-game performance without noticeable latency or artifacts.

**Why this priority**: Music and sound are key differentiators; syncing them to gameplay heightens immersion and reinforces the Lucky Break identity.

**Independent Test**: QA can play a scripted scenario with known collision timing and confirm percussion, tonal shifts, and transitions align with on-screen actions and progression milestones.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a stable internet connection and preloaded assets, **When** the ball strikes bricks or the paddle, **Then** the corresponding audio cues fire within 100 ms of the visual event.
2. **Given** escalating rally length and brick clearance, **When** the player sustains momentum, **Then** the musical arrangement intensifies on the next bar and relaxes when momentum drops.

---

### User Story 3 - Tailor The Experience (Priority: P3)

Players adjust accessibility and comfort settings—such as volume, reduced motion, or control sensitivity—to suit their environment before or during gameplay.

**Why this priority**: Customizable options broaden the audience, reduce frustration, and safeguard long-term engagement.

**Independent Test**: A tester can toggle each setting in isolation, replay a short session, and verify the chosen options persist for the duration of the visit and immediately affect audio, visuals, or controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the settings menu is open, **When** the player lowers master volume or mutes audio, **Then** the change applies instantly and remains in effect after returning to gameplay.
2. **Given** the player opts into reduced motion, **When** beat-synced visual effects would normally play, **Then** the experience uses simplified animations without impairing feedback or legibility.

### Edge Cases

- Ball becomes trapped in a repeating path; the system must intervene within 5 seconds to restore progress.
- Audio playback is blocked by the platform until user interaction; the game should guide the player to enable sound without freezing progression.
- Player loses focus (tab switch or device lock) mid-rally; returning should pause safely and resume without state loss.
- Asset preload fails or partially completes; the game should retry gracefully and communicate status without leaving the player in a dead end.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The game MUST load in modern desktop and mobile browsers, display a responsive playfield, and be ready for input within 10 seconds on a typical broadband connection.
- **FR-002**: The experience MUST present a clear start prompt that captures necessary permissions (e.g., audio) before gameplay begins.
- **FR-003**: Players MUST be able to control the paddle using keyboard, mouse, or touch input with consistent responsiveness across devices.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST track score, lives, remaining bricks, and rally metrics in real time and reflect changes in the on-screen HUD.
- **FR-005**: The game MUST provide reactive sound effects for paddle hits, brick breaks, wall impacts, and power-up events, with <100ms perceived latency and no audio artifacts under normal load.
- **FR-006**: The musical backdrop MUST adapt to momentum indicators (e.g., volley length, brick density) and transition at musical bar boundaries.
- **FR-007**: The experience MUST expose player-adjustable settings for master volume, mute toggle, and reduced-motion visuals, all accessible during play.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST autosuspend gameplay when the page loses visibility (pause physics, audio, and loop; display pause UI) and resume smoothly when focus returns (restore state without loss).
- **FR-009**: The game MUST handle asset loading failures by retrying, offering fallback cues, and clearly informing the player when critical assets remain unavailable.
- **FR-010**: The experience MUST record end-of-round outcomes (win, loss, score, elapsed time) for display in post-round summaries.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: The project MUST track and adopt the latest stable major release for every runtime and build dependency before promoting a release.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Game Session**: Represents a single playthrough, including current level state, score, lives, elapsed time, and active modifiers.
- **Momentum Metrics**: Aggregated indicators such as volley length, ball speed pressure, and brick density that drive difficulty scaling and musical transitions.
- **Player Preferences**: In-memory representation of session-level settings (volume, control sensitivity, reduced motion) applied across menus and gameplay.

## Assumptions

- Lucky Break is delivered as a browser-based, single-player arcade experience targeting keyboard, mouse, and touch controls.
- Asset bundles (audio, textures) are locally hosted and can be prefetched prior to active play.
- The production toolchain will leverage specialized libraries for physics, rendering, and audio, but this specification remains focused on user-facing outcomes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 90% of first-time players reach active gameplay within 10 seconds of loading the page on a broadband desktop connection.
- **SC-002**: 95% of collision-triggered audio cues fire within 100 ms (perceived) of the associated visual event during usability testing.
- **SC-003**: 85% of surveyed players report that music changes match game intensity and feel satisfying after completing three rounds.
- **SC-004**: Fewer than 2% of tracked sessions terminate due to asset load failures or unrecovered audio permission issues over a rolling 30-day window.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: What dependency version policy must Lucky Break follow? → A: Always adopt the latest stable major release for every dependency prior to release.
