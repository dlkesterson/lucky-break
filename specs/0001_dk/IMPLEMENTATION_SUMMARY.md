# Advanced Gameplay Features Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented advanced gameplay mechanics from Cloud Popper and Banana Music Game into Lucky Break. All features are fully integrated, tested, and working.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Paddle Reflection System** (`src/util/paddle-reflection.ts`)
- **Source**: Cloud Popper
- **What it does**: Varies ball bounce angle based on where it hits the paddle
  - Center hits = straight bounces
  - Edge hits = sharper angles (up to ~75°)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Adds tactical depth and skill-based gameplay
  - Reduces predictable straight-line bounces
  - Makes paddle positioning more important
- **Integration**: Applied in collision handler when ball hits paddle

### 2. **Speed Regulation** (`src/util/speed-regulation.ts`)
- **Source**: Cloud Popper
- **What it does**: Keeps ball speed within configured bounds
  - Boosts speed if too slow (prevents stalling)
  - Clamps speed if too fast (prevents tunneling)
- **Benefits**:
  - Maintains consistent gameplay pacing
  - Prevents ball from becoming unplayable
  - Eliminates physics edge cases
- **Integration**: Applied every frame in `afterStep` hook
- **Configuration**: Base speed 8, max speed 14

### 3. **Combo Scoring System** (`src/util/scoring.ts`)
- **Source**: Banana Music Game
- **What it does**: Rewards consecutive brick breaks with multipliers
  - Base points: 10 per brick
  - Multiplier increases every 8 combo (threshold configurable)
  - +25% per threshold (8 combo = 1.25x, 16 = 1.5x, etc.)
  - Combo decays after 1.6 seconds of no hits
- **Benefits**:
  - Adds tension and reward for sustained play
  - Encourages aggressive gameplay
  - More engaging scoring feedback
- **Integration**: 
  - Awards points on brick breaks
  - Decays combo timer each frame
  - Resets on life lost
- **HUD Display**: Shows combo count and timer when active

### 4. **Power-Up System** (`src/util/power-ups.ts`)
- **Source**: Banana Music Game
- **What it does**: Spawns temporary power-ups on brick breaks (25% chance)
  - **Paddle Width**: Increases paddle width by 1.5x for 2.5 seconds
  - **Ball Speed**: Increases ball speed by 1.3x for 2.5 seconds
  - **Multi-Ball**: (Placeholder for future implementation)
  - **Sticky Paddle**: (Placeholder for future implementation)
- **Benefits**:
  - Adds variety and excitement
  - Creates comeback opportunities
  - Visual feedback (paddle color changes to yellow)
- **Integration**:
  - Spawns on brick break
  - Updates each frame with fade-out effect
  - Applies effects to paddle/ball
- **HUD Display**: Shows active power-ups with remaining time

### 5. **Level Progression System** (`src/util/levels.ts`)
- **Source**: Banana Music Game
- **What it does**: Progressive level layouts with increasing difficulty
  - 5 preset levels (loops after completion)
  - Each level has more rows/cols
  - Higher levels have bricks with more HP
  - Adjustable power-up spawn rates
- **Level Progression**:
  - **Level 1**: 3x6 grid, all 1 HP
  - **Level 2**: 4x6 grid, bottom 2 rows have 2 HP
  - **Level 3**: 5x7 grid, HP increases with row
  - **Level 4**: 6x8 grid, more variety
  - **Level 5**: Dense 7x9 grid
- **Benefits**:
  - Provides clear progression
  - Maintains long-term engagement
  - Automatically scales difficulty
- **Integration**: Loads new level on round completion after 500ms delay

### 6. **State Management Updates** (`src/app/state.ts`)
- Added `comboTimer` field to `MomentumMetrics`
- Integrated with scoring system for combo decay tracking
- Resets on life lost and round start

## Technical Details

### Game Loop Integration

**Before Step**:
- Update power-up timers and effects
- Apply paddle width scaling based on active power-ups
- Update paddle visual (color changes for active power-ups)
- Decay combo timer
- Process input and movement

**After Step**:
- **Regulate ball speed** to maintain [8, 14] range
- Update visual positions to match physics

**Collision Handling**:
- **Brick break**: Award combo points, check for power-up spawn, remove brick, check win condition
- **Paddle hit**: Apply advanced reflection based on hit position
- **Bottom wall**: Lose life, reset combo, reset ball to paddle

**After Render**:
- Update HUD with combo info (if active)
- Display active power-ups with timers

### Visual Feedback
- **Combo**: Yellow text showing combo count and remaining time
- **Power-ups**: Cyan text showing active effects and timers
- **Paddle**: Color changes to yellow when power-up is active
- **Bricks**: Color-coded by HP (gray=1, orange=2, red=3+)

## Testing

All features have comprehensive unit tests:

### Test Files Created:
1. `tests/unit/util/paddle-reflection.spec.ts` (10 tests)
   - Reflection angles from different hit positions
   - Minimum speed enforcement
   - Edge case handling

2. `tests/unit/util/speed-regulation.spec.ts` (9 tests)
   - Speed boosting/clamping
   - Direction preservation
   - Edge cases (near-zero velocity)

3. `tests/unit/util/scoring.spec.ts` (17 tests)
   - Combo multipliers
