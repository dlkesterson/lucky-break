# Feature Specification: Implement Advanced Gameplay Mechanics

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-advanced-gameplay`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement advanced gameplay mechanics in Lucky Break including paddle-hit reflection and bounce control, speed regulation and velocity clamping, combo-based scoring with decay and multipliers, power-up spawning on brick breaks, and level progression with preset brick layouts"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Paddle Reflection Control (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want the ball to bounce off the paddle at varying angles based on where it hits the paddle, so the game feels more dynamic and requires strategic positioning.

**Why this priority**: This affects every paddle interaction, making it the most fundamental gameplay enhancement that improves core mechanics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the ball and hitting the paddle at different positions, verifying angle variations without other mechanics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** ball is approaching the paddle from above, **When** ball hits the exact center of the paddle, **Then** ball bounces straight upward at the same speed.
2. **Given** ball is approaching the paddle, **When** ball hits the left edge of the paddle, **Then** ball bounces at a 75-degree angle to the left.
3. **Given** ball is approaching the paddle, **When** ball hits the right edge of the paddle, **Then** ball bounces at a 75-degree angle to the right.
4. **Given** ball velocity is preserved, **When** ball hits paddle at any position, **Then** ball maintains its speed after bounce.

### User Story 2 - Speed Regulation (Priority: P1)

As a player, I want the ball speed to be automatically regulated to stay within playable limits, so the game maintains consistent pacing without becoming too slow or too fast.

**Why this priority**: Speed control is essential for game balance and prevents frustrating gameplay states.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by observing ball speed over time during gameplay, ensuring it stays within defined bounds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** ball speed drops below minimum threshold, **When** physics update occurs, **Then** ball speed is increased to minimum speed.
2. **Given** ball speed exceeds maximum threshold, **When** physics update occurs, **Then** ball speed is reduced to maximum speed.
3. **Given** ball is moving normally, **When** ball speed is between min and max, **Then** ball speed remains unchanged.

### User Story 3 - Combo Scoring System (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want consecutive brick breaks to build combos with increasing multipliers that decay over time, so I'm rewarded for maintaining momentum.

**Why this priority**: Adds scoring depth and replayability, encouraging skilled play.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by breaking bricks in sequence and observing score multipliers and decay.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no recent brick breaks, **When** first brick is broken, **Then** combo counter increases to 1 with base score.
2. **Given** combo is active, **When** another brick is broken within decay time, **Then** combo counter increases and score multiplier applies.
3. **Given** combo timer expires, **When** decay completes, **Then** combo counter resets to 0.
4. **Given** combo reaches multiples of 8, **When** brick is broken, **Then** additional multiplier bonus is applied.

---

### User Story 4 - Power-Up Spawning (Priority: P3)

As a player, I want occasional power-ups to spawn when breaking bricks, providing temporary advantages and adding excitement.

**Why this priority**: Adds variety and surprise elements to gameplay.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by breaking bricks and observing random power-up activation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** brick is broken, **When** random chance triggers (25%), **Then** power-up activates with visual and effect cues.
2. **Given** paddle width power-up is active, **When** timer is running, **Then** paddle width increases gradually over time.
3. **Given** power-up timer expires, **When** effect ends, **Then** paddle returns to normal size.

---

### User Story 5 - Level Progression (Priority: P3)

As a player, I want levels to advance with preset brick layouts of increasing difficulty, so the game provides progression and challenge.

**Why this priority**: Enables longer play sessions with escalating difficulty.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by completing rounds and observing new brick field generation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all breakable bricks are destroyed, **When** round completes, **Then** new level loads with preset layout.
2. **Given** level advances, **When** new layout loads, **Then** brick count and HP increase appropriately.
3. **Given** level progression, **When** reaching level boundaries, **Then** layouts cycle or end game.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when ball hits paddle at extreme edge positions?
- How does speed regulation handle very low velocity (near zero)?
- What happens to combo when game is paused or interrupted?
- How do power-ups interact with existing paddle modifications?
- What happens if level layouts exceed screen boundaries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST calculate ball bounce angle based on paddle hit position relative to paddle center.
- **FR-002**: System MUST apply maximum 75-degree bounce angle when ball hits paddle edges.
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve ball speed during paddle bounces.
- **FR-004**: System MUST clamp ball speed to minimum threshold when it drops too low.
- **FR-005**: System MUST clamp ball speed to maximum threshold when it exceeds limits.
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain ball speed between minimum and maximum values during normal play.
- **FR-007**: System MUST track consecutive brick breaks as combo counter.
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply score multipliers based on combo length (increasing every 8 hits).
- **FR-009**: System MUST decay combo counter to zero after 1.6 seconds of inactivity.
- **FR-010**: System MUST spawn power-ups randomly (25% chance) when bricks are broken.
- **FR-011**: System MUST apply paddle width boost (1.5x) for 2.5 seconds when power-up activates.
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide visual feedback during power-up duration.
- **FR-013**: System MUST load preset level layouts with increasing difficulty.
- **FR-014**: System MUST advance to next level when all breakable bricks are destroyed.
- **FR-015**: System MUST increase brick count and HP in higher level layouts.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Combo State**: Tracks current combo count, timer, and score multiplier
- **Power-Up State**: Tracks active power-ups, timers, and effects
- **Level Spec**: Defines brick layout patterns, HP distribution, and difficulty progression

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Players can achieve ball bounce angles up to 75 degrees by hitting paddle edges.
- **SC-002**: Ball speed remains between minimum and maximum thresholds throughout gameplay sessions.
- **SC-003**: Players can build combo multipliers up to 5x through consecutive brick breaks.
- **SC-004**: Combo counters decay to zero within 2 seconds of inactivity.
- **SC-005**: Power-ups activate on approximately 25% of brick breaks.
- **SC-006**: Paddle width increases by 50% during power-up duration.
- **SC-007**: Levels progress automatically with increasing brick counts and HP.
- **SC-008**: Game maintains playable state across all implemented mechanics.

## Assumptions

- Base ball speed and min/max thresholds follow existing game configuration standards.
- Score multipliers increase every 8 combo hits as demonstrated in reference projects.
- Power-up spawn rate of 25% provides balanced excitement without overwhelming gameplay.
- Level layouts follow progressive difficulty patterns from reference projects.
- Visual feedback for power-ups uses color changes as shown in examples.
- Combo decay timer of 1.6 seconds provides appropriate tension window.
