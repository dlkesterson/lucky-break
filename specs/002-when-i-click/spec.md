# Feature Specification: Paddle Control and Ball Launch

**Feature Branch**: `002-when-i-click`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "when i click on Tap to Start, the game starts but the ball should start at the paddle, and only move once I move the paddle or click/tap to initiate the round. also, it didn't seem like i could move the paddle"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Ball Starts at Paddle Position (Priority: P1)

As a player, when I start a round, I want the ball to begin positioned on the paddle so I can see where it will launch from and have control over the initial direction.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental gameplay mechanic - players need to know where the ball will start and have control over its initial trajectory.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a round and verifying the ball appears centered on the paddle with zero velocity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a round has just started, **When** the game initializes, **Then** the ball appears centered on the paddle with zero velocity
2. **Given** the ball is positioned on the paddle, **When** the paddle moves, **Then** the ball moves with the paddle maintaining its relative position

### User Story 2 - Ball Launches on Paddle Movement or Tap (Priority: P2)

As a player, I want the ball to launch either when I move the paddle or tap/click to initiate the round, giving me control over when gameplay begins.

**Why this priority**: This provides player agency over the start of gameplay and prevents accidental launches.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by positioning the ball on paddle, then either moving paddle or tapping to launch, and verifying ball begins moving with appropriate velocity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** ball is positioned on paddle with zero velocity, **When** I move the paddle left or right, **Then** the ball launches with upward velocity
2. **Given** ball is positioned on paddle with zero velocity, **When** I tap/click anywhere on screen, **Then** the ball launches with upward velocity
3. **Given** ball is positioned on paddle, **When** I move the paddle without launching, **Then** the ball stays attached to the paddle position

### User Story 3 - Paddle Movement Controls (Priority: P3)

As a player, I want to be able to move the paddle left and right using mouse, touch, or keyboard controls to position it for gameplay.

**Why this priority**: Basic paddle control is essential for gameplay but secondary to ball positioning and launch mechanics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to move paddle with different input methods and verifying it responds appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** paddle is visible on screen, **When** I move mouse left/right, **Then** paddle follows mouse horizontally
2. **Given** paddle is visible on screen, **When** I use left/right arrow keys, **Then** paddle moves left/right
3. **Given** paddle is visible on screen, **When** I touch and drag on touch device, **Then** paddle follows touch position horizontally

### Edge Cases

- What happens when paddle reaches screen boundaries during movement?
- How does ball launch behave if paddle is moving rapidly when launch is triggered?
- What happens if multiple launch inputs occur simultaneously?
- How does the system handle ball launch if paddle position changes between launch input and physics update?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST position the ball centered on the paddle when a round starts
- **FR-002**: System MUST keep ball velocity at zero until launch is initiated
- **FR-003**: System MUST launch ball with upward velocity when paddle moves left or right
- **FR-004**: System MUST launch ball with upward velocity when user taps/clicks screen
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow paddle movement via mouse, touch, or keyboard input
- **FR-006**: System MUST constrain paddle movement within game boundaries
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain ball position relative to paddle until launch

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Ball**: Game object with position, velocity, and attachment state to paddle
- **Paddle**: Player-controlled game object with position and movement constraints
- **Input Handler**: Processes user input (mouse, keyboard, touch) for paddle control and launch triggers

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Players can successfully launch ball within 3 seconds of round start in 95% of attempts
- **SC-002**: Paddle responds to input with less than 50ms latency
- **SC-003**: Ball maintains proper attachment to paddle during positioning phase
- **SC-004**: Launch mechanics work consistently across mouse, keyboard, and touch inputs
